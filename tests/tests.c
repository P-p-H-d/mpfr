 * occur in practice, either by the calling software or by some other
 * library or plug-in used by the calling software. This option is
 * mainly for developers. If it is used, then the <fpu_control.h>
 * header is assumed to exist and work like under Linux/x86. MPFR does
 * not need to be recompiled. So, a possible usage is the following:
 *
 *   cd tests
 *   make clean
 *   make check CFLAGS="-g -O2 -ffloat-store -DMPFR_FPU_PREC=_FPU_SINGLE"
 *
 * i.e. just add -DMPFR_FPU_PREC=... to the CFLAGS found in Makefile.
 *
 * Notes:
 *   + SSE2 (used to implement double's on x86_64, and possibly on x86
 *     too, depending on the compiler configuration and flags) is not
 *     affected by the dynamic precision. However, it can be affected
 *     by the flush-to-zero (FTZ) and denormals-are-zero (DAZ) flags
 *     in the MXCSR register for subnormals.
 *   + When the FPU does not have its usual configuration, the behavior
 *     of MPFR functions that have a native floating-point type (float,
 *     double, long double) as argument or return value is not guaranteed.

/* Check the behavior around the overflow/underflow thresholds by using
   the inverse function (argument inv).
   Argument name is the name of the tested function (for messages).
   Arguments pxmax and pymax are the maximum precisions for x and y
   when considering y = fct(x) or x = inv(y). Precisions are tested
   starting at MPFR_PREC_MIN. If pxmax > 64 and pymax > 64, then
   pxmax and pymax are overridden by the MPFR_TESTS_OFUF_PMAX
   environment variable (when defined), and precisions are tested
   in geometric progression. Otherwise all precisions are tested.
   If the function is locally increasing, use decr = 0.
   If the function is locally decreasing, use decr = 1.
   Argument threshold is the threshold type: positive or negative,
   overflow or underflow (see the beginning of the code). Macros are
   defined in mpfr-test.h: POSOF, POSUF, NEGOF, NEGUF.
   Note: Unfortunately, there are some interesting arguments for the
   inverse function that are outside the extended exponent range,
   e.g. 2^(emax+1) and 2^(emin-1). Thus the current test is limited
   (though it should be able to detect the most problematic bugs).
   There would be 3 solutions:
     1. Have a test build where the MPFR_SAVE_EXPO_MARK macro would use
        global variables instead of MPFR_EMIN_MIN and MPFR_EMAX_MAX. To
        generate the testcases, these global variables could temporarily
        be set to MPFR_EMIN_MIN-1 and MPFR_EMAX_MAX+1 respectively, but
        with no guarantee that this will work. Alternatively, they could
        be set to MPFR_EMIN_MIN+1 and MPFR_EMAX_MAX-1 respectively (or
        powers of 2) for the test of the library, but again, there may
        be fake failures (not a real issue for the developers).
     2. Generate testcases on a 64-bit build for a 32-bit target (where
        the extended exponent range is smaller). Then copy these testcases
        in the testsuite (they will be significant only on 32-bit hosts,
        but bug fixes could benefit all hosts).
     3. Determine the expected results manually, with maths.
   TODO: It could be a good idea to introduce some randomness in the tested
   precisions, since in case of a small mistake in the error analysis of
   the functions, it is possible that the test succeeds most of the time
   and fails in some cases. But first, a study needs to be done on the pow
   bugs present before 2023-03-02, in order to make sure to do the right
   thing; this is a good example, as with *all* precisions from 1 to 128,
   a failure occurs only for (xprec,yprec) = (127,50), (128,47), (128,50)
   [positive overflow] and (63,1) [positive underflow], i.e. about 0.01%
   of the cases.
*/
/* FIXME: Since underflow is after rounding, the test does not seem to
   be correct in some cases of MPFR_RNDN. Add comments to describe all
   the possible cases and fix the code. For underflow, consistency
   checks could be added when testing various precisions, as the true
   underflow threshold increases with the precision.
   Also check whether there isn't the same kind of issue for overflow. */
